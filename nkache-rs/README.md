# NKACHE (WIP)

This is an attempt to implement an efficient cache simulator for testing and verification of cache-related algorithms.

The speed of the python implemented simulator is ok for now, but it is not enough for the future. So, I am planning to implement a native version of the simulator.

This might be similar to ChampSim, but more focused on the cache part.
