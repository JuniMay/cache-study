# Replacement Algorithm

This directory contains the implementation of the replacement algorithm.

`rlr` is the reproduction of the paper [Designing a Cost-Effective Cache Replacement Policy Using Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCA51647.2021.00033). Note that some details might be different from the paper.

`tracegen` is used to generate LLC trace used for reinforcement learning.
